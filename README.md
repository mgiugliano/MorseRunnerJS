# Aims

This is an experimental repository where exchanges, discussions, experiments, and actual work are channelled towards porting/rewriting Morse Runner as a (universal) webapp. 

Morse Runner is a widely known, Windows-only (http://www.dxatlas.com/morserunner/), training software for ham radio operators interested in CW. It has been developed actively for years by Alex Shovkoplyas (VE3NEA) as freeware and its (Delphi Pascal) source code has been generously released on GitHub.

TL;DR: watch the video

## Collaborating and developing

This is an attempt at rebooting/rewriting/porting Morse Runner in JavaScript, as a webapp. It is based on the powerful audio library Web Audio (see https://web.dev/webaudio-intro/), which is the underlying layer for Fabian Kurz (DJ5CW)'s fantastic library (https://github.com/dj1yfk/jscwlib).


jscwlib should indeed make life extremely easy. See by yourself and appreciate Fabian's example for a pileup https://fkurz.net/ham/jscwlib/example/pileup.html . 



## Testing (as GitHub pages)

Point your browser to https://mgiugliano.github.io/MorseRunnerJS/www/ to play and test.

## Install and deploy with Docker

### Using docker compose
You can deploy the image using a `docker-compose.yml` followed by `docker-compose up -d`:
```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  morserunner:
    container_name: morserunner
    image: ghcr.io/f4iey/morserunnerjs:main
    ports:
        - "8080:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Or using `docker run`:
```sh
docker run -d --name morserunner -p 8080:80 --restart unless-stopped ghcr.io/f4iey/morserunnerjs:main
```

After deployment, you can look at the page on `http://localhost:8080`
